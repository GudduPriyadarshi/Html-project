	Bulgarian stamps first appeared in 1879.  The image above shows the first postage stamp of Bulgaria.  The Cyrillic inscription at the top of the oval reads "Bulgarian Postage".  The Cyrillic inscription at the bottom of the oval reads "Five Centimes".  The central design features the lion from the Bulgarian coat-of-arms.  The new Bulgarian postage stamps are very similar in design and size to the Russian Imperial postage stamps of the time.<br>

Map of Bulgaria in 1877


When the Second Bulgarian Empire collapsed in 1396, all the Bulgarian territories south of the Danube River became a principality within the  Ottoman Empire.  The Bulgarian struggle for independence during the 18th and 19th Centuries led to the April Uprising in 1876.  The brutality of the Ottomans, in putting down the uprising, resulted in the Russian Empire declaring war on the Ottoman Empire in 1876.  The Russian forces, with the aid of many Bulgarian soldiers, were victorious.  

On March 3, 1878, as a result of the Treaty of San Stefano, Romania, Serbia, and Montenegro became independent kingdoms, and Bulgaria became an autonomous principality within the Ottoman Empire.  The self-governing Principality of Bulgaria would not actually be free of Ottoman external control until October 5, 1908, when it became the Kingdom (or Tsardom) of Bulgaria.

Of course, Bulgaria has an impressive (recorded) history, dating back to the 5th Century B.C., as part of the Ancient Greek geographical area known as Thrace, the Thracian province of the Roman Empire, and even as an Empire in its own right.  These historical roots have been well documented on the postage stamps of Bulgaria.<br>
<img src="bul3.jpg" id="b3"><br>
Since the first Bulgarian postage stamp of 1879, more than 5,000 different postage stamps have been issued, with most of them being reasonably affordable.  Collecting Bulgarian stamps can offer many years of enjoyment and can result in a very impressive looking collection.  The subject matter of Bulgarian commemorative stamps also offers many different thematic collecting possibilities.

Reviews of many of the postage stamp issues of Bulgaria, as well as the occasional historical article, will eventually appear in the page link section at the upper right.

Illustrating and describing ALL the stamps of modern Bulgaria is far beyond the scope and capability of this website.  Fortunately for everyone, someone has already done that.  Here is a link to an excellent website illustrating all the stamps of Bulgaria.<br>

The four commemorative stamps shown above (Sc. #43-46) were issued on February 2, 1896 to celebrate the upcoming Baptism of Prince Boris.

The common designs of the four stamps feature the Coat of Arms of Bulgaria.

Boris Klemens Robert Maria Pius Ludwig Stanislaus Xavier (1894-1943) was the eldest son of Prince Regnant Ferdinand of Bulgaria (1861-1948) and Princess Marie Louise of Bourbon-Parma (1870-1899).  The two year old prince was baptized in the Eastern Orthodox Church on February 11, 1896.  His godfather was Tsar Nicholas II of Russia.<br>

The two commemorative stamps shown above (Sc. #53-54) were issued on April 20, 1901 to celebrate the 25th Anniversary of the Insurrection for Independence in April 1876, also called the April Uprising.

The common designs of the two stamps feature a Cherry-Wood Cannon.

The Bulgarians used 52 Cherry-Wood Cannons during the 1876 April Uprising.  These wooden cannons, though ineffective in battle, became one of the symbols of the Bulgarian struggle for independence from the Ottoman Empire.<br>

The Defense of the Eagle's Nest
by Alexey Popov (1858-1917)

<img src="bu4.jpg" id="b8"><br>


The three pictorial Bulgarian stamps shown above (Sc. #70-72) were issued on August 29, 1902 to commemorate the 25th Anniversary of the Battle of Shipka Pass in the Russo-Turkish War.

The common designs of the three stamps are based on the 1893 painting, "The Defense of the Eagle's Nest", by the Russian painter Alexey Popov (1858-1917).

The Battle of Shipka Pass was actually four battles, fought between August  1877 and January 1878, which were decisive Russo-Bulgarian victories.  A small force of about 2,500 Russian troops and about 5,000 Bulgarian volunteers succeeded in holding Shipka Peak, also known as the Eagle's Nest, against an Ottoman army of overwhelming size.  The victory enabled the Russo-Bulgarian forces to crush the Ottoman army at Philippopolis and go on to threaten Constantinople itself.  The Russo-Turkish war soon ended, enabling Bulgaria to free itself from internal Ottoman control and to become a self-governing principality.<br>

The three commemorative Bulgarian stamps shown above (Sc. #74-76) were issued on August 12, 1907 to celebrate the 20th Anniversary of the Accession to the Throne by Ferdinand I.

The common designs of the three stamps feature portraits of Prince Regnant Ferdinand in 1887 and in 1907.

<p id="p4">
	The first pictorial definitive Bulgarian stamps appeared in 1911, and from that point forward, almost all the definitive stamps of Bulgaria have been  large-format pictorial or portrait stamps.  The period between 1911 and 1928 would also witness the unexpected departure of one monarch and the ascension of another monarch.






The twelve major-type pictorial and portrait definitive Bulgarian stamps shown above were issued between 1911 and 1915.

Their designs are as follows.

01 S. - Tsar Assen's Tower.  The fortress of Tsar Asen II (Reigned: 1218-1241), who reigned during the Second Bulgarian Empire.  The Church of the Holy Mother of God is all that remains of the original fortress today, and it is still in use, as a Bulgarian Orthodox Church.
02 S. - Tsar Ferdinand.
