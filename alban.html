<h3>
100th Anniversary of the Albanian Postal Service
Commemorative Stamps Issued in 2013


The first printed definitive postage Albania stamps appeared in late 1913, though provisional issues were in use from the middle of that year.  

On December 5, 1912, a week after Albania gained its independence from the Ottoman Empire, the Provisional Government founded the Albanian postal service, as part of the Ministry of Telegraphs and Communications. 




Provisional Albanian Postage Stamp of 1913


The new Albanian government became a member of the Universal Postal Union in 1913.  In May of 1913, the first Albanian stamp appeared, being a hand-stamped seal applied directly to letter envelopes  In June of 1913, the Albanian Postal Service began utilizing existing stocks of the postage stamps, newspaper stamps, and postage due stamps of the Ottoman Empire, overprinting them for use as provisional definitive Albanian postage stamps. 




George Castriot (1405-1468), a.k.a. Skanderbeg
Albanian Stamp Issued in December 1913


The first portrait definitive Albania stamp, shown above, bears the likeness of "Skanderbeg".  He was a 15th Century Albanian Noble, initially in the service of the Ottoman Empire.  The Ottomans compared his military abilities to those of Alexander the Great, and they gave him the nickname "Iskender bey" meaning "Lord Alexander".  In a 1459 document, George Castriot signed his name as "Скендьрь бегь" or "Skender beg".  Over the centuries, the title has been anglicized into "Skanderbeg".  

Between 1443 and 1468, he rebelled against the Ottoman Empire and fought to bring independence to the Albanian people.  He has since been the symbol of the Albanian peoples' struggle for independence, and elsewhere in Europe, he has been regarded as the role model of Christian resistance against the Muslim Ottoman Empire.

The 20th Century was not very kind to Albania or to its people, being a time of political and social chaos from the beginning to almost the end of the century.  During that time, Albania was a province of the Ottoman Empire, an independent principality, a constitutional republic, a constitutional kingdom, under Italian occupation, under German occupation, and a socialist peoples' republic.  It wouldn't be until the very end of the century that Albania would evolve into the stable, Western-style parliamentary republic that it is today.  Albania stamps fully reflect these changes, throughout the 20th Century.

The stamps of Albania can provide a wealth of historical knowledge, as well as years of enjoyment, to any stamp collector.  The more modern pictorial stamps of Albania also provide a wealth of material for the thematic stamp collector, as well.

<h2 id="hj" align="center">airmail stamps of 1925-1929</h2><br>
<img src="air1.jpg" id="i1"> 
<P id="p0">
	Albania stamps for airmail letter postage, issued between 1925 and 1929, all feature the same design, with that being a contemporary commercial passenger aircraft flying above a mountainous landscape.  As with the pictorial definitive postage stamps of this time, new airmail stamps for special events were created by overprinting existing airmail stamps.

The monoplane shown on these stamps is probably a German-built Dornier (or similar model) passenger aircraft of the type used by the German "Aero-Lloyd" charter airline.  They were the parent company of the Albanian "Adria Aero-Lloyd" domestic airline, which was founded in February 1925.  At the time, "Adria Aero-Lloyd" provided domestic passenger service between Tirane, Shkoder, Vlore, and Korce.





The seven airmail stamps shown above (Sc. #C1-C7) were issued on May 30, 1925.  These stamps are typographed on paper that is watermarked lozenges, and they are all perforated 14.

These airmail stamps exist imperforate, and as such, they are rare.  An example is shown at the top of this page.
<img src="air2.jpg" id="pp"><br>




The seven diagonally overprinted airmail stamps shown above (Sc. #C8-C14) were issued on January 18, 1927, identifying Albania as a Republic.

The diagonal overprint on the stamps is "Rep[ublika] Shqiptare" or the "Republic of Albania".

These stamps exist with inverted and double overprints.  Examples of them are relatively common and quite affordable.






The seven overprinted airmail stamps shown above (Sc. #C15-C21) were issued on April 21, 1928, to celebrate the First International Flight by Adria Aero-Lloyd from Vlore, Albania to Brindisi, Italy.
<img src="air3.jpg" id="pi"><br>
The overprint on the stamps is "REP SHQIPTARE / Fluturim' i I-ar / Vlone-Brindisi / 21.IV.1928" or the "Republic of Albania / Flight by Air / 21 April 1928".  The distance from Vlore to Brindisi is about 83 miles.  In a passenger aircraft of the time, the trip would have taken less than one hour.

The 5 Q. denomination exists with an inverted overprint.  It is not terribly expensive.

A "SHQIRTARE" overprint error occurs once in every pane of stamps.  Its value is about three times that of the regular stamp.





The seven overprinted airmail stamps shown above (Sc. #C22-C28) were issued on December 1, 1929, identifying Albania as a Kingdom.

The overprint on the stamps is "Mbr[eteri] Shqiptare" or the "Kingdom of Albania".

Most of the stamps in this set are rather expensive, and as would be expected, forgeries of the overprint exist.
