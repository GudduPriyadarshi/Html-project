		The historically strategic island of Cyprus is located in the Mediterranean Sea, South of Turkey, Southeast of Greece, and North of Egypt.  This strategic location has played a significant role in Mediterranean history for over 30 Centuries!

The island of Cyprus, though previously inhabited from Neolithic times, was formally settled by Mycenaean (Bronze Age) Greek traders during the 2nd Millennium B.C.  The Greek word, Κύπρος or Kýpros, is believed to be derived from the ancient Sumerian word for "copper", as the island was a major source of copper / bronze during antiquity. 

Cyprus plays a principle role in Greek Mythology, as it is considered the birthplace of both Aphrodite and Adonis.<br>

The First Postage Stamps of Cyprus (1880)


In 1878, following the end of Russo-Turkish War and the conclusion  of the Congress of Berlin, the island was made a Protectorate of the British Empire, in exchange of guarantees that Great Britain would use the island as a base to protect the Ottoman Empire from further aggression by Russia.  During the early 20th Century, the island would serve as a major military base, protecting Great Britain's colonial trade routes.<br>

With the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Great Britain formally annexed the island of Cyprus, and in 1925, the island officially became a Crown Colony.  The island would continue to serve as an important British military base, throughout the first half of the 20th Century.  On August 16, 1960, Cyprus became an independent republic.

		Issues of 1880-1896




The first Cyprus stamps appeared in 1880.  These first definitive postage stamps for the new British Protectorate were produced by overprinting the contemporary postage stamps of Great Britain.

In 1878, following the end of Russo-Turkish War and the conclusion  of the Congress of Berlin, the island was made a Protectorate of the British Empire, in exchange of guarantees that Great Britain would use the island as a base to protect the Ottoman Empire from further aggression by Russia.  The island would eventually serve as a major military base, protecting Great Britain's colonial trade routes to Africa and Asia.

With only one exception, the stamps of 1880 were denominated in British Currency.  From 1881, all of the stamps, with a couple exceptions, were denominated in Turkish Piasters.  All of the stamps of Cyprus, issued between 1880 and 1896, bear the left-facing portrait of Queen Victoria.<br>

		For commemorative Cyprus stamps, the big event of 1953 was the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.  A brand new series of pictorial definitive stamps were implemented in 1955, coinciding with the establishment of a new currency for Cyprus.

Far reaching social and political changes were in progress in Cyprus during this period, and ultimately, only sixteen stamps would be issued for the reign of this new monarch.





The commemorative stamp shown above (Sc. #167) was issued on June 3, 1953 to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.  

The design features one of the many photographs of the young queen taken by Dorothy Wilding (1893-1976), during February 1952, just a few days after the accession of the new monarch.<br>

The fifteen pictorial and portrait definitive Cyprus stamps shown above (Sc. #168-182) were issued on August 1, 1955.  These stamps are all engraved, and they are printed on paper with the Multiple Crown and Script CA watermark.

The designs feature the Dorothy Wilding portrait of Queen Elizabeth II and the following pictorial subjects.

002 M. -- Carobs.

On August 16, 1960, Cyprus became an independent republic, and eighty-two years of British colonial rule came to an end.

The pictorial definitive stamps issued in 1955 were overprinted "REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS" in both Greek and Turkish for provisional use by the new Cypriot government.  These provisional definitive postage stamps (Sc. #183-197) continued in use, until the first definitive stamps of the Republic of Cyprus were issued in 1962.  

An example is shown directly above.  The overprints are spaced and placed differently on each of the stamps in the set, depending on the particular stamp's dimensions.<br><br>
